This is my implementation of CodeCademy's objective of creating a functioning e-commerce webbsite using Java Servlets. I used Visual Studio Code for this project!

What I learned:

- General understanding of Apache's Tomcat and how to start/shutting it down.
* General undersstanding of Java Servlets (implementation, servlet container, doGet, doPost, sendRedirect() etc.).

In order to try my implementation, make sure to include the provided folder in the 'webapps' folder within your Tomcat directory. You can register a new user to login.

I want to add some more functionality to this project in the future like giving the user the chance to change his first-/lastname or remove items from their cart!
